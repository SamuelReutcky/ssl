              <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
              <p>
                SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a technology that keeps your
                internet connection secure. It makes sure that any data sent
                between your computer and a website is private and protected.
                When you see a padlock icon in the address bar of your browser,
                it means SSL is being used to keep your information safe.

              <h2>What is TLS?</h2>
              <p>
                TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a technology that keeps your
                data safe when you use the internet. It works by encrypting the
                information, making it hard for anyone else to see or change it.
                You often use TLS when browsing websites, sending emails, and
                other online activities.

              <h2>What does it mean to be secure?</h2>
              <p>
                To stay secure online, use strong, unique passwords and enable
                two-factor authentication (2FA). Look for HTTPS and the padlock
                icon before entering sensitive info on websites. Avoid public
                Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks, or use a VPN. Be cautious of phishing
                scams and keep your software updated. These steps help keep your
                personal information safe.

              <h2>How can I tell that my webpage is secure?</h2>
              <p>To check if a webpage is secure, look for these signs:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  HTTPS: The web address should start with “https://” instead of
                  “http://”. The “s” stands for secure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Padlock Icon: There should be a padlock icon in the address
                  bar. Clicking on it will give you more details about the
                  site’s security.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Security Certificate: Click on the padlock icon to view the
                  SSL certificate details. This shows that the site is verified
                  and secure
                </li>

              <h2>What is encryption and why do I care?</h2>
              <p>
                Encryption turns your data into a secret code to keep it safe
                from hackers and unauthorized access. It ensures that only you
                and the intended recipient can read the information. This is
                important because it protects your personal details, like
                passwords and credit card numbers, making your online activities
                more secure and private. By using encryption, you can have peace
                of mind knowing your sensitive information is protected.

              <h2>
                Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when we're talking about
                secure websites?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Yes, the prefixes HTTP and HTTPS are important for secure
                websites. HTTP sends data as plain text, which isn’t secure.
                HTTPS adds encryption, making the data private and secure. So,
                when you see HTTPS in the web address, it means the website is
                protecting your information, making it safer to use.

              <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>
              <p>
                An SSL certificate authority is a trusted organization that
                gives out digital certificates to websites. These certificates
                prove that the website is secure and that its identity has been
                verified. When you visit a website with an SSL certificate, your
                browser trusts that the site is safe because it has been checked
                by a CA
